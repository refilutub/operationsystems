| Command / Term      | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `owner`             | The user who owns a file. Usually, it's the user who created the file.      |
| `group`             | A set of users. Each file has one group owner that defines group access.    |
| `permission`        | Access rights for files: read (r), write (w), execute (x).                  |
| `UID (User ID)`     | A numeric ID assigned to each user. File ownership is tracked using the UID.|
| `GID (Group ID)`    | A numeric ID assigned to each group.                                        |
| `id`                | Displays the current user's UID, GID, and all groups the user belongs to.   |
| `groups`            | Shows all groups the current user is a member of.                           |
| `ls -l`             | Lists files with detailed info, including permissions and ownership.        |
| `ls -la`            | Same as `ls -l` but includes hidden files (those starting with `.`).        |
| `ls -ld`            | Lists info about the directory itself, not its contents.                    |
| `chmod`             | Changes permissions of a file or directory.                                 |
| `chmod u+x file`    | Grants execute permission to the file owner (user).                         |
| `chmod 755 file`    | Sets file permissions to `rwxr-xr-x`.                                       |
| `chown`             | Changes the owner of a file or directory.                                   |
| `chgrp`             | Changes the group ownership of a file or directory.                         |
| `newgrp`            | Changes the current primary group of the user for the session.              |
| `umask`             | Defines default permission settings for newly created files/directories.    |
| `touch file`        | Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing one.          |
| `setuid`            | When set on an executable, the file runs with the permissions of its owner. |
| `setgid`            | Files run with group permissions; new files in a directory inherit its group.|
| `sticky bit`        | Prevents users from deleting others’ files in shared directories.           |
| `symbolic link`     | A shortcut to another file, like a Windows shortcut (`.lnk`).               |
| `hard link`         | Another name for the same file data on disk, fully equal to the original.   |
| `exit`              | Exits the current shell session (e.g., after using `newgrp`).               |
